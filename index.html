        <h3>Who I am</h3>
        <p>Hi, Thanks for stopping by.  My name is Drew. I am actively pursuing my dream carreer in front end web development. I enjoy the challegnes it comes with, but also how rewarding the outcome can be.
            My life isn't only in front of a computer. I love spending time outdoors with my family. Whether it's on a hike, by the lake, of just out in the backyard I enjoy it all. Feel free to contact me to get to know me more or
            with a career opportunity you think I might be interested in.  
        </p>
